"Staging Fright – NYU Shanghai – Spring 2017
Instructor: Antonius Wiriadjaja
Description:
Haunted houses. Scary movies. Ghost stories. What is fear and why do we sometimes seek to induce it? This course will cover the challenges and possibilities of creating and incorporating interactive media in live and unpredictable environments in order to incite the fear response. Students will explore fear as an emotional reaction and also as a method for expressing certain ideas. Technologies, new and old, that attempt to measure the physiological processes behind being afraid will be explored and discussed. Students are expected to analyze movies, games and other media in the horror and thriller genres to better paint a picture on how fear works. Programming interfaces and creating physical computing props will be the primary vehicles for the class. Interaction Lab is a prerequisite, along with a daring disposition.
Objectives:
To explore new methodologies of digital media in performance and the performing arts.
To explore fear as an emotion."
